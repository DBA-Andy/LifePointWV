# Setting up Sunday Slides Overview
- Matthew will send his notes by Thursday morning, but there could be changes.  Final notes by noon on Sunday.
  - We work from his outline, not the notes in the e-mail.  Look for the highlighted items in his outline.  
    - If there are talking points between verses, thatâ€™s an indication the verses will be on separate slides.
- We download the worship slides from [Lifepoint's FTP server](https://gofile.me/6WE6j/VxLTcyStx)
  - We can either do this on our local machine and upload them to the mac mini (what I do) or we can download directly from the mac mini (benefit of only one transfer delay)
- We import the worship slides and add them to our new playlist
- We set up the sermon slides

## Creating the playlist
- Duplicate the list called "Duplicate this List!" by Right-Clicking on the list and selecting duplicate.

- Drag the Playlist to the desired Series folder, then right-click and rename it, based on the date of service.

## Downloading the worship slides
### As mentioned above, we can either download to our local machine and upload to the mac mini, or download directly to the mac mini
  - I've historically chosen to download to my machine then upload to the mac mini to minimize the number of places my google drive account is logged in.
  - Now that Lifepoint is putting everything on [Lifepoint's FTP server](https://gofile.me/6WE6j/VxLTcyStx), it might be just as fast to download there.
### Complete the download
  - Go to [Lifepoint's FTP server](https://gofile.me/6WE6j/VxLTcyStx).  There is no authentication that I'm aware of.
  - Double-click on "Series."
  - Double-click on the "Current Series."
  - Double-click on the "Date of Service" you need to download worship slides for.
  - Download the appropriate "PROPLAYLIST file"

### Upload to Mac Mini if you downloaded to your local machine (Optional)
