## Running Service
- We currently run 3 services.  One at 9 a.m., one at 10:30, and one at 12:00.  
  - Each service follows the same basic pattern, though there are sometimes additions.

### Worship
  - As the timer runs down, we're watching the worship leader for a "thumbs up" that they're ready.  When we get that, the audio engineer will fade the music, and we'll select option "4" (worship) on the lighting panel.
  - Generally speaking, automation is handling everything for the worship set, but we're watching to make sure all goes well.
    - Keep an eye on the monitor and make sure slides are advancing on time (automation hasn't disconnected)
    - Check the confidence monitor periodically and make sure the words are continuing to show up for the worship team.
  - If there is a pastoral moment, we do select the first slide to fade the background during the pastoral moment.
  - Once worship completes, there is generally a "meet and greet."  Once the worship leader announces "please greet someone near you" we'll select option "2" (walk-in/walk-out) and the sound engineer will turn the music back up.
### Message
  - We're now watching for the teaching pastor to be ready to start speaking.  When they appear ready, we'll select option "5" (message)  on the lighting panel.
  - I've started printing Matthew's outline so I have a good feel for when he's about to say something that should trigger a slide on the screen, but in general, we're watching for patterns each service and making sure the slides show up when they're expected.
### Closing Song
  - After the message has been delivered, it's time for the closing worship song.  Back to option "4" (worship) on the lighting panel.
### Announcements
  - There are usually announcements after the closing worship song.  Select option "3" on the lighting panel to put the focus on the person doing announcements.  We're now working through the "announcements" section and putting slides up as the announcer talks about them.
    - There's generally a "call" to visit next steps (flash next steps slide).
    - There's generally something about "we're so grateful for the way you give" (flash the giving slide).
    - It's 50/50 whether they call for the "LP Guest" slide or not.  Follow the queues.
### Dismissal
  - After announcements, we dismiss - Back to option "2" on the lighting panel, and the sound engineer will fade the music back up.
  - Play the "Closing loop" slide for a few minutes before setting up for next service.
