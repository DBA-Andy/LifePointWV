## Sunday morning Setup - Rehearsal
- When we arrive on Sunday, we power on the devices that will be used for Visual effects during service.
  - There are 3 remotes in the booth near the mac mini.  They are for the Projector, the Roku TV (Confidence Monitor), and the Apple TV (Confidence Monitor).
    - The Confidence monitor runs off the HDMI 1 input on the Roku TV and works wirelessly with the Mac Mini
  - To try to prevent issues during service, we reboot the mac mini and the apple TV on arrival.

- Reboot the Mac Minu and launch both pro presenter and spotify.  
- Turn on the Roku TV
- Proceed to the stage and power on the Projector that is mounted on the ceiling above center stage, behind the speakers.
- By now, the Roku TV will have started.  
  - Navigate to the Apple TV input.
  - Using the Apple TV remote (the top portion acts like a touchpad for a laptop), reboot the Apple TV.  
    - If you're unfamiliar with Apple TV, you can review this [support page](https://support.apple.com/guide/tv/restart-apple-tv-atvbb8553426/tvos) for instructions.
  - Once the Apple TV has rebooted, we need to launch the "Stage" app.
    - Use the apple TV remote to navigate to the stage app and launch it.
    - When the stage app has launched, use the remote to enter the password.  It's very secret...It's:  stage
- Now, we're ready for rehearsal to start.
